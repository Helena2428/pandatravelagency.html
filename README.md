    <h1>Koekohe Beach</h1> 
      <hr />
      <p>In New Zealand you can find a beautiful beach called Koekohe Beach where 
     mysterious stones have appeared along the beach which are called "Moeraki boulders." 
     According to scientists these stones were washed ashore by a canoe called the Araiteuru 65 million years ago. 
     Now I am not here to tell you facts about these stones however, I am here to tell you that this 
      place is the best place to go on your next destination! Keep on reading to find out
      more about Koekohe Beach!!</p><!--End of Paragraph 1-->
      <h2>Reasons to come to Koekohe Beach</h2>
      <p>A few reasons you should go to this beautiful beach is the Moeraki boulders that have washed
      upon the shore are the most fascinating and most popular attraction on the beach. Another reason
      is these boulders are very popular for photographs when the sun is shining near the rocks making
      your photographs the best you have ever taken!! I recommend that you take these photographs
      during the wee hours of the morning and later on in the afternoon. One final reason is 
      that there isn't only one stone lying on the Koekohe Beach but there are over 50 beautiful
      stones to admire during your visit!!</p><!--End of Paragraph 2-->
      <h3>Other things to do during your visit</h3>
      <p>There's more to do than to look at these stones you can walk to the viewpoint
      above the village where you can see out of this world views of the beach! If you are lucky
      you can also find sheep in which you are able to play with these fun animals. So stop and 
      play with these fun loving sheep!! You can also walk along the beach where you can find 
      piers and great places to take photos with your family or your loved one. If you love penguins
      and seals then go on a hunt for them at the Katki post Lighthouse but unfortunately  
      the lighthouse is blocked off so sorry to the photographers you can't take photographs
      nor walk right up to it. You can also visit a tiny church which is a great place to take
      a photograph outside but yet again the Church is blocked off. And finally you can also 
      go fishing which is the most popular thing to do here in Koekohe Beach!!<!--End of Paragraph 3-->
